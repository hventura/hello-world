### **Hello World!**

Hello all! My name is Helder, currently I'm a Backend / Android
Developer but my studies start in audio-visual (Movie, image and sound
editing), web design (html, dreamweaver) and after that, with some
forcing from my family i went to law school. Now-a-days i don't regret
it but it was difficult at the begining and after 5 years in law school
i didnÂ´t finish the course. Anyways, now i have the knowledge of law and
doing something i love... Coding :)

In my way to being a developer i found some tutorials, and courses. I
did a course call 'Specialist Technician in Development of Information
Systems' (Level V in Qualification Board - Portugal). In the course i
learned the basis of programing and found out that what i really wanted
was to keep digging knowledge in Java (for Android) and PHP for the
backend / Server side.

After finish i started working in Primelayer where i work util now.

My know how now includes:
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript (with jQuery)
- PHP (using Codeigniter 3 & 4)
- Kotlin (in Android Development)
- kTor (for server side API's)
