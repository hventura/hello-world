### **Hello World!**

Greetings! I'm Helder, currently immersed in the dynamic realm of Android development. While my educational journey commenced in audio-visual studies, including movie, image, and sound editing, and later delved into web design with HTML and Dreamweaver, I eventually found my true passion in coding.

Although there was a detour through law school, the pursuit of knowledge in the legal field concluded after five years. However, this detour proved valuable as it equipped me with a unique blend of legal insight and a profound love for coding.

My trajectory towards becoming a developer took shape through tutorials and courses, notably the 'Specialist Technician in Development of Information Systems' program (Level V in Qualification Board - Portugal). Here, I honed my programming foundations and discovered my eagerness to delve deeper into Java for Android development and PHP for backend/server-side operations.

Post-graduation, I embarked on my professional journey at Primelayer, where I have been actively engaged in Android development. My current skill set encompasses:
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript (including jQuery)
- PHP (utilizing Codeigniter 3 & 4)
- Kotlin (for Android Development)
- kTor (for server-side APIs)

This amalgamation of skills allows me to navigate seamlessly between frontend and backend, ensuring a comprehensive approach to application development. I am enthusiastic about continually expanding my Android development proficiency and overcoming any challenges that come my way.
