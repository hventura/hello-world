Hello all!
HVentura here, currently I'm a law student but my studies start in audio-visual (Movie, image and sound editing), web design (html - dreamweaver) and after that, with some forcing from my family i went to law school. Now-a-days i don't regret it but it was difficult at the begining and after 5 years i'm still in 2nd year of law school. Anyways, now it's "on track" but i never left the knowledge of computing and now i try to bring toghether the two things i learn to love, LAW and Computing.
That brings me here to github to learn and share what i know.

/* After some months learning and studing programing languages, i find Java and JavaScript suitable for my purpose. For that i will continue to learn Java and JScript. */

//As for that, here is my first java coding with the common 'Hello World' citation:

//-------------------------------------------

public class MyFirstJavaCode {

  public static void main (String[] args) {
  
      System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
}
