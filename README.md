# hello-world

Hello all!
HVentura here, currently I'm a law student but my studies start in audio-visual (Movie, image and sound editing), web design (html - dreamweaver) and after that, with some forcing from my family i went to law school. Now-a-days i don't regret it but it was difficult at the begining and after 5 years i'm still in 2nd year of law school. Anyways, now it's "on track" but i never left the knowledge of computing and now i try to bring toghether the two things i learn to love, LAW and Computing.
That brings me here to github to learn and share what i know.
